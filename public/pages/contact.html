        <h3>About</h3>
        <p class="about">
            I am currently a student at Western Washington University pursuing
            a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science. I love solving interesting
            questions, and creating short insightful projects that really challenge
            my capabilities. I am currently looking for a software engineering position
            on the west coast post-graduation in December 2020.

        <h3>About</h3>
        <p class="about">
            I'm a senior at the University of Washington and looking for a job in
            information technology or game development around the Seattle region.
            programming, art, and game development are my passion and I'm looking
            for a chance to further that passion with work. I'm an all around fast
            learner when it comes to computers and know just a little bit of everything.
